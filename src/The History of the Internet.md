# The History of the Internet
We'll start with the basics. This file contains the history of the Internet. Obviously, this is not the complete history, but it contains some of the most crucial pieces of information that make the Internet what it is today.

First, what exactly is the Internet? The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks for communication between networks and devices. Think of it like a network of networks. For more information see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) article. 

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet) is the source for the main content of this timeline.

## Why was the Internet created?
Before 1983, virtually every computer lived in its own world. They had no contact with each other. Of course, with certain companies there were networks where computers could talk to each other but publically this didn't exist. Actually, the Internet was first created for military purposes. While people all over the world were working to invent the Internet, the U.S. Department of Defence research arm known as the Advanced Resarch Projects Agency (ARPA) -- note you might recognize this group's current name the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -- had enough funding and manpower to carry it out. Without ARPA, the Internet would have never been created. In 1969 ARPA had created a network of computers (called ARPANET) that connected universities, government agencies, and defense contracotrs from around the country. ARPANET was a huge hit but it wasn't the Internet. It had a huge problem -- it wasn't mobile. If the government wanted to use this technology on the front lines, they couldn't be lugging around computers the size of entire rooms and have them all be hard wired together. To solve this problem there were two things that needed to happen. First, was to build a wireless network that could relay information by radio or satellite. The second was to connect this wireless system to the current ARPANET. This was called "internetworking". 

People already had invented ways for networking -- computers talking to one another. But, getting networks to talk to other networks was a whole new challege. This is why the Internet was invented.

## So, what came first?
Actually, the first inventions that really helped push the Internet to reality started in 1920 with Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley. An idea known as [[Internet History Support Info#Information Theory|information theory]] which set the stage for transferring information wirelessly. In 1948, Claude Shannon finished this theory by working on trannsmitting without losing information (telecommunications technology). The final pieces in the puzzle was transistor technology (see [[Internet History Support Info#MOS Transistors|MOS transistors]]) and laser technology. Even with all of these emerging technologies, computers could only send files using point-to-point communication, which still required a physical connection. In addition, this technology was vulnerable (and this was meant for the military) because there was not back up systems in place if the physical link was ever broken. 

Febuary 1959: Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for [[Internet History Support Info#Time-Sharing|time-sharing]] which would lead to the creation of a computer network. 

After this, the next great invention was [[Internet History Support Info#Packet Switching|packet switching]]. This removed the problems with data not completely sending when there was a lot of information. 

## Great, now what?
Now that the technology was ready, some prototype network systems were created. These include the [[Internet History Support Info#National Physical Laboratory Network|NPL Network]], [[Internet History Support Info#ARPANET|APRANET]], [[Internet History Support Info#CYCLADES|CYCLADES]], . 






# Topics for future discussion
Here I will include topics that I have come across in my research that I have not yet gotten to in this document or I don't really have a place for it to go. 

## Richard Hamming
When dealing with error detection/correction. Hamming created the first error correction models. This was when punchcards were used to input code, not a terminal
