# README
Welcome! This document contains important information you should know before diving in to everything else. While I initally intended this Vault to only contain information specifically pertaining to ethical hacking, I realized that understanding a topic like that required a much more broad view of the Internet and other technologies first. The end goal of this compilation of information is to understand ethical hacking and how to properly implement it.

## Seeing the markdown files
You can view the files as standard markdown files (.md). Standard linking to external files does work. However, to get full access to backlinking, download the files and open them as a Vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). This will allow you to link to other documents so you can easily find information to whatever you are currently reading. I highly recommend doing this.

## Documents
There are a number of documents contained in the src folder. Below is a description of each.

### Internet History Support Info
This document contains supporting information for The History of the Internet document. It expands on specific topics and helps to fill in some of the gaps. This document is not meant to be read on its own. Using backlinking, it connects to The History of the Internet document.

### Terms and Definitions
This document contains terms and definitions related to computing, programming, or anything else technology related. The goal with this document is to compile information that will eventually be moved into seperate curated documents as I see fit. 

### The History of the Internet
This document contains a timeline with specific events that lead up to and happened after the creation of the Internet. Much of the information in this document links to the Internet History Support Info document.
